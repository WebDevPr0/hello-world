hello-world
===========

Welcome to my very first file on github. I hope this will be the first of many.
When I first started using computers as a kid, I noticed that over time, computers tend to get slower and full of junk. So I started teaching myself how to fix computer issues and I got really good results. Then pop-ups, and various viruses. Eventually, I decided to learn about building websites and that's how I eventually became a webmaster. I now work for an international diamonds company and part of my responsibilities includes updating diamonds.net and creating the weekly pricesheet for the diamond industry. I recently developed a beautiful website for my company: symposium.rapnet.com

I plan to learn more web development tools: Github, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET...
